In this assignment, you’re assigned to create a website that displays rockets. This website only has two screens: rocket list screen and rocket detail screen. Here are the requirements:

### Functional Requirements
- As a user, I want to see a list of rockets in the rocket list screen (Show each rocket image, rocket name, and rocket description)
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the rockets in the rocket list screen
- As a user, I want to be able to add the new rocket in the rocket list screen
- As a user, I want to be able to see the rocket detail by clicking a rocket in the rocket list screen (Show rocket image, rocket name, rocket description, cost per launch, country, first flight)

### Notes
- the create rocket features requires API key from the author, there's no information on how to get the api key. and based on the documentation theres not a single project implementing the Create function with this API.
